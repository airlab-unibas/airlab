    """
    Image loader is a class to download and cache images. Currently, the 6 4DCT datasets of the POPI model are supported.
    The downloaded images are cached in a temporary folder, such that, if the image is loaded twice, it will be taken
    from that folder. If landmark points are available too, they are downloaded and cached as well. The class is
    implemented as singleton in order to hold a database of cached images only once and consistent.
    Using the show() method, one can print the different images which can be loaded. They are grouped into subjects
    and images. For example: 4DCT_POPI_2 image_30 means, the subject 4DCT_POPI_2 and the third image of the respiratory
    cycle.
    Usage:
    loader = ImageLoader("/tmp/")
    (image, points) = loader.load("4DCT_POPI_2", "image_30")
    If no landmark points are defined, points is set to None.
    In the generate_database() other images can be registered to the database.
    Note: the provided publicly available images have been published for research purposes. If you are using them for
          your research, please cite the authors appropriately.
